# IoT Webcam & Humidity Controller

My proposal for Assignment 02 is to build an IoT-based baby monitor for my newborn baby that uses a motion sensor to activate video streaming via the Pi Camera Module V2, ideally over the Internet, but at least over the home network, viewable on a webpage. Although sound is a more obvious trigger for activiting the camera, we always hear her when she starts crying from across the house (she's a loud one!), but motion sensing will give us an indication of whether she's sleeping restlessly before she wakes and starts crying.

I am also proposing to control the power to a simple humidifier in the room using the SenseHAT's humidity sensor and an IFTTT compatible wifi smart socket.
